2) Eight feed ingredients are listed under the heading "Feedstuff," and there is an edit box to the right of each ingredient.
3) Enter the percentage of each ingredient that will go in the final feed mixture in the edit boxes.
4) Once all percentages are entered, "Total: 100" should be displayed below the edit boxes.
5) Click the calculate button. 
6) Energy, crude protein, crude fiber, crude fat content, and total mineral content will then be displayed beneath the calculate button in the window.
